Three of the most notable elements of my SuperPy are the buy and product code generators, ability to get graphical reports on several days at once and products with defaults and flexibility to change them.
Each bought item (or amount bought at the same time) gets it's own buy code to make it easier to keep track of which transaction is which. Each product stored in products.csv gets it's own product code. Of course none of these codes can be the same, and to have a person randomly typing codes untill a unique one is found will become an issue down the line. The generator functions solve this issue completely, it will get you a unique code. Right now it supports up to 90.000 different product codes and pretty much endless amounts of buy codes. Product codes can even be changed if the user wants to (and if their code is unique of course)
Reporting for one day at a time can be time consuming if you actually want the report from a week, month or longer. It is still possible to get a bar chart of today's transactions if you enter one date. Should you enter a second, it will switch to a line chart to see the same transactions over the period between the dates you passed in. Though it will get a bit messy when your time period gets very big, with overlapping numbers, the graphs shown will still be a good overvieuw in way less time than it takes to enter and run every date one at a time.
Entering a buy price or expiracy date every time will become tedious if one or both are always the same. This is why SuperPy stores defaults for prices and expiracy times. The can always be overridden when the actual transaction takes place, but from working with consumables myself I know that often times things stay the same for long periods. Everything about the stored products can be changed to the users' liking, the change product parser is just as flexible as adding a new product.
